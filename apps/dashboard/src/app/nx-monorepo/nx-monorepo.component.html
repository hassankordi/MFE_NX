        <h3> NX Introduction!</h3>
           <!-- <p>In the world of modern web development, managing large-scale applications efficiently is a major challenge. 
            Nx, an advanced build system and monorepo tool, simplifies development by providing a structured and scalable approach</p> -->
            <p>
                Imagine youâ€™re managing <b>multiple food trucks</b>, each selling a different type of foodâ€”burgers, pizza, sushi. 
                If every truck worked in isolation, theyâ€™d struggle with <b>shared resources, coordination, and efficiency.</b> 
                But what if you had a system that helped them <b>share ingredients, manage orders faster, and reduce waste?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="ms-4">
                Thatâ€™s exactly what Nx tool does for Micro Frontends! Instead of handling multiple apps separately, 
                Nx provides a powerful monorepo solution
            </p>
        <!-- <h3>
            What is NX?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nx is a monorepo development <b>"Tool"</b> that enables developers to manage multiple projects within a single repository. 
        </p> -->
        
        <h3>
            Why NX?
        </h3>
        <p>
           Nx do all possible to separating my features into small <b>libraries</b> and <b>applications</b>,
            and then use Nx to manage them all in a single repository. 
            This approach has several benefits:

            <li>
               <span>  Monorepo Structure:</span>
                Nx allows developers to maintain multiple applications and libraries in a single repository.
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
               <span>
                Code Generation and Scaffolding:
               </span> 
               With powerful generators, Nx enables teams to create components, 
               modules, and entire applications using pre-configured templates, ensuring consistency across the project.
            </li> -->

                <span>
                    Dependency Graph Visualization:
                </span> 
                One of Nxâ€™s unique features is its ability to generate a visual graph of dependencies, 
                helping developers understand relationships between applications and libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Technology Flexibility:
                </span> 
                Nx supports multiple frameworks like Angular, React, Node.js, NestJS, and more. 
                <p style="font-size: 8px;">we need to focus on Angular Framework (To keep my chair at GlobeMed)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Module Federation Support:
                </span> 
                Nx integrates seamlessly with Module Federation (Webpack 5), enabling Micro Frontends (MFEs) to dynamically share and load modules at runtime, improving modularity and performance.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- //**CHALLENGES OF MFE  **/// -->
        <h3>
            Summary:
        </h3>
       <p>
        Nx is the best tool to keep Micro Frontends fast, scalable, and easy to manage! To fully leverage its benefits, we need to invest time in learning Nx, Module Federation, and best practices for building a future-proof system. ðŸš€
