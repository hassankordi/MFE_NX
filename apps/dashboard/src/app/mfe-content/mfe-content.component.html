        <h3>Micro Frontends Overview!</h3>
           <!-- <p>
            In recent years, Micro Frontends Architecture has emerged as a popular trend in systems design, 
            especially for large-scale web applications. As the front-end landscape becomes increasingly complex, 
            monolithic architectures are showing their limitations. Micro frontends offer a solution by breaking down front-end applications into smaller, 
            manageable pieces.
           </p> -->
           <p>
            Imagine a large shopping mall where each store operates independently but provides a seamless experience for 
            visitors. Micro Frontends work similarly, breaking a large application into smaller, independently developed 
            parts that come together smoothly.

           <p>___ Mirroring the principles of microservices on the backend.</p>

            Why Use Micro Frontends?
        </h3>
        <!-- <p>
            Micro frontends is an architectural approach where a front-end application is divided into smaller, 
            independent pieces that are developed, tested, and deployed separately. 
            Each piece or "frontend" operates like a microservice and can be owned by different teams. 
            These pieces are later integrated into the main application, offering a seamless user experience.

            Why Micro Frontends Matter ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            As applications grow, maintaining a single codebase becomes more challenging. 
            The benefits of micro frontends include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Scalability:</span> Large teams can work in parallel without bottlenecks, ideal for distributed teams.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Faster Development & Deployment:</span> Teams can release updates independently without dependencies on other parts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Code Maintainability:</span> Smaller codebases improve management, testing, and debugging with better modularity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Technology Flexibility:</span> Teams can choose the best tools and frameworks for their needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Independent Deployment:</span> Each micro frontend can be deployed separately, reducing risks and allowing faster rollbacks or updates without affecting the entire application.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <!-- <ol>
            <li>
               <span> Scalability:</span> Large teams can work on different parts of the application concurrently without running into bottlenecks. 
                This is especially important for organizations with distributed teams.
            </li>
            <li>
               <span>
                Faster Development and Deployment:
               </span> Independent teams can release updates to their micro frontend without 
                waiting for other parts of the application to be ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Code Maintainability:
                </span> Smaller codebases are easier to manage, test, and debug. 
                Micro frontends allow for better separation of concerns and modularity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Technology Flexibility:
                </span> Teams can select the best tools and frameworks for their specific needs, 
                rather than being constrained by a single stack.
            </li>
           
        </ol> -->
         <!-- <li>
                <span>
                    Improved User Experience:
                </span> Because micro frontends can be deployed independently, it is easier to implement A/B testing and canary releases, 
                allowing for rapid user feedback and iteration.

            Challenges of Micro Frontends ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although micro frontends solve many issues of scalability and maintainability, they introduce new challenges:
        </p>
        <!-- <ol>
            <li>
               <span> Performance Overhead:</span> Multiple micro frontends can lead to performance degradation due to increased network requests, 
              <b> larger bundle sizes</b>, and potential duplication of code.
            </li>
            <li>
               <span>
                Consistency:
               </span> Maintaining a consistent user experience across multiple independently developed micro frontends can be difficult. 
               Global styles, design patterns, and UX standards need to be enforced.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Cross-Team Collaboration:
                </span> While the autonomy of micro frontends is a strength, it also means that collaboration between teams must be well-coordinated, 
                especially when making changes that affect multiple parts of the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Deployment Complexity:
                </span> Managing independent deployments of each micro frontend can introduce deployment complexity, 
                especially when dealing with shared resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Poor Community Support:
                </span> 
                 As micro frontends are still a relatively new concept, 
                 the community and ecosystem around them are not as mature as those for more established architectures. 
                 This can lead to a lack of best practices, tools, and resources, making it harder to find solutions to common problems.
            </li>
        </ol> -->
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>Performance Issues:</span> More network requests, <b>larger bundle sizes</b>, and possible code duplication.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Inconsistent UI:</span> Hard to maintain a uniform design across different micro frontends.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Team Coordination:</span> Changes affecting multiple parts require strong collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Complex Deployment:</span> Managing separate deployments can be challenging.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Limited Community Support:</span> Fewer resources and best practices compared to traditional architectures.
